<h1>PteroPlug - AutoPlug egg for Pterodactyl server panel.</h1>
This is still kinda WIP, but it's mostly working.

Contact LunaUwU#6969 for additional server types.

<h3>Currently supported server software:</h3>
<li>Purpur - https://purpurmc.org/</li>
<li>Paper - https://papermc.io/</li>
<li>Spigot - https://www.spigotmc.org/</li>

<h3>Known Issues:</h3>
<li>Enabling/Disabling updates for Java, Server, Plugins, Mods, AutoPlug not functional after first run.</li>
<li>Changing game version not possible after first run.</li>
(These are both due to Pterodactyl not working well with AutoPlug configuration files. Cannot be fixed currently.)<br>
(Can still be changed in the config files.)

<h3>TO-DO:</h3>
<li>(Maybe) Fix PaperMC "hotswap" not working.</li>
<li>Add more server types.</li>

<h3>Things that work:</h3>
<li>Setting AutoPlug server key (Needed for most features)</li>
<li>Custom Java start arguments</li>
<li>"Hotswap" between Purpur and Spigot</li>

<h3>Special thanks to:</h3>

<li>Pterodactyl - https://pterodactyl.io/</li>
